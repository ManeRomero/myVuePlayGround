# myVuePlayGround
In here I'll develope my lil experiments zone. Take care, it could maybe explode!
________________________________

As a medium level (better lowly) web developer, I've been searching in a ocean of knowledge.. pure blur concepts about everything was coming to my head.. also the magnificent Vue. Now I'm in a position to say that I'm really ready to make this, once I've learned the 'scss working flux', moreover to handle the html standards and the JavaScript Universe (of course, not all the 'planets').

After some litle proyects, using the 1% of real Vue performance, I walk through a self-challenged way to find that real Vue power. This is my little playGround in where I'll try to reach to the next objectives:

1. Be able to understand and get profit of the 'CC' (Components Concept | this is my own nomenclature).

2. Expand the binding data: no more 'fixed file' source. Welcome to the real Ferrari.

Vue is my favourite framework.. and I only worked the 1%!! In a future, These will be the steps 'todo':

a => { Handle the routing and server calls enterelly with the Vue Eco. Make a secure REST API }

b => { Communicate with API's, in order to allow that data (AMAZON WEB SERVICES, CLOUDINARY...), and also to bring some available contents from thirds agents.

So okay, don't be afraid if you see some strange here. It's just a playGround!
